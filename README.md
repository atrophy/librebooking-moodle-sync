# LibreBooking Moodle Synchroniser
Synchronise passing gradebook items from Moodle to group membership in Librebooking

## Why does this exist?
We use [LibreBooking](https://github.com/effgarces/BookedScheduler) to manage equipment bookings, but before a student can book a machine they need to be trained in how to use it. Using Quizzes and Assignments in Moodle we track what students have been trained to use, this synchroniser automatically adds students that have completed the appropriate training to groups in LibreBooking.
